This was an attempt at a minimal prayer times app. It's free and open source forever isA. 

I used the Al-Adhan Api: https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api

Prayer times use the Islamic Society of North America calculation method. This site does not track you. You can see the source code for this site here: https://github.com/ultrafro/prayertimes
